# ML-Pipeline
Building ML Pipelines Demo

In this project, we will be using a dataset containing bone marrow transplantation characteristics for pediatric patients from UCI’s Machine Learning Repository.

This dataset will be used to build a pipeline, containing all preprocessing and data cleaning steps, and then selecting the best classifier to predict patient survival.
